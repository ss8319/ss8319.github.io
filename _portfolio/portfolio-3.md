title: '<a href='https://ai.sil.org/projects/serval'>Domain Adaptation of Neural Multilingual Translation Models</a>'
excerpt: "TLDR: During my time at SIL Global, I researched on low-resource machine translation focusing on data augmentation, data extraction, supervised fine-tuning, improving tokenizer support and growing embeddings to support new languages. The project is now maintained under [Project Serval](https://ai.sil.org/projects/serval) which integrates with [Scripture Forge](https://ai.sil.org/projects/scriptureforge)."
