title: "<a href='https://ai.sil.org/projects/serval'>Domain Adaptation of Neural Multilingual Translation Models</a>"
excerpt: "TLDR: During my time at SIL Global, I researched low-resource machine translation focusing on data augmentation, data extraction, supervised fine-tuning, improving tokenizer support and growing embeddings to support new languages. The project is now maintained under <a href='https://ai.sil.org/projects/serval'>Project Serval</a> which integrates with <a href='https://ai.sil.org/projects/scriptureforge'>Scripture Forge</a>."
