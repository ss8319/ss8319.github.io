I am a Medical AI Engineer and Researcher at Qmed Asia and Computational Biomedical Engineering (Honors) graduate from Imperial College London. 

Iâ€™ve worked on transfer learning/domain adaptation @SIL Global, built cell segmentation and tracking tools during my undergraduate @ Imperial College London, and am now buildling medical LLM applications @ Qmed Asia. I am currently writing a survey journal paper on LLMs & Reasoning. 

I am passionate about working at the intersection of Machine Learning, Healthcare and Medicine, leveraging the best of Machine Learning to make healthcare more efficient, cost-effective, and universally accessible.
