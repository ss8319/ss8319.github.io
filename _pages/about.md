I am a Medical AI Engineer and Researcher at Qmed Asia and Computational Biomedical Engineering (Honors) graduate from Imperial College London. 

I’ve worked on transfer learning/domain adaptation on multilingual low-resource translation @SIL Global, built cell segmentation and tracking tools during my undergraduate @ Imperial College London, and am now buildling medical LLM and Computer Vision applications @ Qmed Asia. I am currently writing a survey journal paper on LLMs & Reasoning. Recently, I published a paper on QLoRA training using 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors (CPU) that obtained training speeds comparable to an A100 GPU, using Google’s TCMalloc and Intel® Advanced Matrix Extensions.

I am passionate about working at the intersection of Machine Learning, Healthcare and Computational Biology. I am particularly intrigued by the challenges of Continual Learning, including Continued Pretraining, and Domain Adaptation. My goal is to develop algorithms that are not only theoretically sound but also practical and deployable in real-world applications.
