I am a Medical AI Engineer and Researcher at Qmed Asia and Computational Biomedical Engineering (Honors) graduate from Imperial College London. 

Iâ€™ve worked on transfer learning/domain adaptation on multilingual low-resource translation @SIL Global, built cell segmentation and tracking tools during my undergraduate @ Imperial College London, and am now buildling medical LLM and Computer Vision applications @ Qmed Asia. I am currently writing a survey journal paper on LLMs & Reasoning. 

I am passionate about working at the intersection of Machine Learning, Healthcare and Computational Biology, leveraging the best of Machine Learning to make healthcare more efficient, cost-effective, and universally accessible.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning, with a strong focus on data-efficient approaches. I am particularly intrigued by the challenges of Continual Learning, including Continued Pretraining, and Domain Adaptation. My goal is to develop algorithms that are not only theoretically sound but also practical and deployable in real-world applications.
