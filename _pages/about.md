I am an AI Research Assistant at Monash University, Medical AI researcher at MedARC and Computational Biomedical Engineering (Honors) graduate from Imperial College London. I'm passionate about applying Machine Learning to tackle complex challenges in healthcare, medicine, and the life sciences.

I’ve worked on transfer learning/domain adaptation on multilingual low-resource translation @SIL Global, built cell segmentation and tracking tools during my undergraduate @ Imperial College London, and built medical LLM and Computer Vision applications @ Qmed Asia.

Currently, my research focuses on:
- Benchmarking self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques for radiology foundation models across downstream radiology tasks
- Multimodal AI integration, combining proteomics and MRI data to detect Alzheimer’s disease and uncover biomarkers
