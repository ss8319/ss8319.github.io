I am a Healthcare AI Engineer at Qmed Asia and Computational Biomedical Engineering (Honors) graduate from Imperial College London. 

Iâ€™ve worked on transfer learning/domain adaptation on multilingual low-resource translation @SIL Global, built cell segmentation and tracking tools during my undergraduate @ Imperial College London, and am now buildling medical LLM and Computer Vision applications @ Qmed Asia. 

I am passionate about working at the intersection of Machine Learning, Healthcare and Computational Biology. I am particularly intrigued by the challenges of Healthcare, Medicine and Biology and the applications of Machine Learning in these fields.
